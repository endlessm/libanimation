 *
 * The reason why we need this code is that for the wobbly effect,
 * both the model and the renderer must agree on the geometry of the
 * surface to be animated. In the case of clutter, ClutterDeformEffect
 * is a subclass of ClutterOffscreenEffect, such that the actor is first
 * painted into an FBO, then the FBO is rendered with the specified mesh.
 *
 * However, "behind our back", clutter will make the FBO a little bit
 * bigger than the actual actor geometry, meaning that if we were to
 * deform vertices as though the surface size was the same as the actor
 * size, we would actually be "pinching" the FBO every so slightly, leading
 * to an irritating visual glitch where the window gets slightly smaller
 * as soon as it starts moving.
 *
 * Therefore, we tell clutter that the actor paint box is the normal actor
 * paint box extents without any effects applied as usual, but we tell
 * libanimation that the model is the same size that clutter would have
 * computed the FBO to be, such that the FBO size and the model size
 * agree and there is no "pinching" effect.

  /* The aim here is that for a given rectangle defined with floating point
   * coordinates we want to determine a stable quantized size in pixels
   * that doesn't vary due to the original box's sub-pixel position.
   *
   * The reason this is important is because effects will use this
   * API to determine the size of offscreen framebuffers and so for
   * a fixed-size object that may be animated accross the screen we
   * want to make sure that the stage paint-box has an equally stable
   * size so that effects aren't made to continuously re-allocate
   * a corresponding fbo.
   *
   * The other thing we consider is that the calculation of this box is
   * subject to floating point precision issues that might be slightly
   * different to the precision issues involved with actually painting the
   * actor, which might result in painting slightly leaking outside the
   * user's calculated paint-volume. For this we simply aim to pad out the
   * paint-volume by at least half a pixel all the way around.
